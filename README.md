# Hybrid-Cloud-Networking-site-to-site-VPN-
Site-to-Site VPN connection between AWS and on premises environment


## Executive Summary

The present solution is meant for providing levarage between cloud inftrastructure scalability and on-premises control of sensitive data. A site-to-site VPN was established in order to encrypt the communication
between the two segments of the built architecture, where both can communicate efficiently, relicably and in a secure manner, as if both environmens would be in the same local area network. The solution provides a nice degree of flexibility due to its hybrid architecture and on top of that, is meant to be improved for the future.



## Architecture

As it is in the shown architecture diagram above, the architecture is divided into two main segments, the on-premises architecture and the cloud infrastructure handled by AWS.
